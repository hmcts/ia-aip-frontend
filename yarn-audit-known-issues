However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations.\n\n## Impact\nThis vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution.\n\n## Mitigation\nThis vulnerability is patched in json5 v2.2.2 and later. A patch has also been backported for json5 v1 in versions v1.0.2 and later.\n\n## Details\n \nSuppose a developer wants to allow users and admins to perform some risky operation, but they want to restrict what non-admins can do. To accomplish this, they accept a JSON blob from the user, parse it using `JSON5.parse`, confirm that the provided data does not set some sensitive keys, and then performs the risky operation using the validated data:\n \n    const JSON5 = require('json5');\n \n    const doSomethingDangerous = (props) => {\n      if (props.isAdmin) {\n        console.log('Doing dangerous thing as admin.');\n      } else {\n        console.log('Doing dangerous thing as user.');\n      }\n    };\n \n    const secCheckKeysSet = (obj, searchKeys) => {\n      let searchKeyFound = false;\n      Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {\n        if (searchKeys.indexOf(key) > -1) {\n          searchKeyFound = true;\n        }\n      });\n      return searchKeyFound;\n    };\n \n    const props = JSON5.parse('{\\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\"}');\n    if (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n      doSomethingDangerous(props); // \\\"Doing dangerous thing as user.\\\"\n    } else {\n      throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n    }\n \nIf the user attempts to set the `isAdmin` key, their request will be rejected:\n \n    const props = JSON5.parse('{\\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\", \\\"isAdmin\\\": true}');\n    if (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n      doSomethingDangerous(props);\n    } else {\n      throw new Error('Forbidden...'); // Error: Forbidden…\n    }\n \nHowever, users can instead set the `__proto__` key to `{\\\"isAdmin\\\": true}`. `JSON5` will parse this key and will set the `isAdmin` key on the prototype of the returned object, allowing the user to bypass the security check and run their request as an admin:\n \n    const props = JSON5.parse('{\\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\", \\\"__proto__\\\": {\\\"isAdmin\\\": true}}');\n    if (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n      doSomethingDangerous(props); // \\\"Doing dangerous thing as admin.\\\"\n    } else {\n      throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n    }\n ","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h"}}}

However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations.\n\n## Impact\nThis vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution.\n\n## Mitigation\nThis vulnerability is patched in json5 v2.2.2 and later. A patch has also been backported for json5 v1 in versions v1.0.2 and later.\n\n## Details\n \nSuppose a developer wants to allow users and admins to perform some risky operation, but they want to restrict what non-admins can do. To accomplish this, they accept a JSON blob from the user, parse it using `JSON5.parse`, confirm that the provided data does not set some sensitive keys, and then performs the risky operation using the validated data:\n \n    const JSON5 = require('json5');\n \n    const doSomethingDangerous = (props) => {\n      if (props.isAdmin) {\n        console.log('Doing dangerous thing as admin.');\n      } else {\n        console.log('Doing dangerous thing as user.');\n      }\n    };\n \n    const secCheckKeysSet = (obj, searchKeys) => {\n      let searchKeyFound = false;\n      Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {\n        if (searchKeys.indexOf(key) > -1) {\n          searchKeyFound = true;\n        }\n      });\n      return searchKeyFound;\n    };\n \n    const props = JSON5.parse('{\\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\"}');\n    if (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n      doSomethingDangerous(props); // \\\"Doing dangerous thing as user.\\\"\n    } else {\n      throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n    }\n \nIf the user attempts to set the `isAdmin` key, their request will be rejected:\n \n    const props = JSON5.parse('{\\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\", \\\"isAdmin\\\": true}');\n    if (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n      doSomethingDangerous(props);\n    } else {\n      throw new Error('Forbidden...'); // Error: Forbidden…\n    }\n \nHowever, users can instead set the `__proto__` key to `{\\\"isAdmin\\\": true}`. `JSON5` will parse this key and will set the `isAdmin` key on the prototype of the returned object, allowing the user to bypass the security check and run their request as an admin:\n \n    const props = JSON5.parse('{\\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\", \\\"__proto__\\\": {\\\"isAdmin\\\": true}}');\n    if (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n      doSomethingDangerous(props); // \\\"Doing dangerous thing as admin.\\\"\n    } else {\n      throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n    }\n ","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h"}}}
