When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content (e.g. password, configuration files, private source code, ...).\n\nIf the development server is listening on a public IP address (or **0.0.0.0**), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port).\n\nIf the server allows access from third-party domains (CORS, **_Allow-Access-Origin: *_** ), an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files.\n\n### Recommendation\nThe URL should be unescaped and normalized before any further processing.","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wr3j-pwj9-hqq6"},"1096820":{"findings":[{"version":"4.17.1","paths":["express","dyson>express"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<4.19.2","module_name":"express","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc","cves":["CVE-2024-29041"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=4.19.2","cvss":{"score":6.1,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"},"updated":"2024-03-27T21:47:29.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 4.19.2 or later","cwe":["CWE-601","CWE-1286"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1096820,"references":"- https://github.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc\n- https://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800\n- https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539\n- https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\n- https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n- https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29041\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc","created":"2024-03-25T19:40:26.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"Express.js Open Redirect in malformed URLs","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"### Impact\n\nVersions of Express.js prior to 4.19.2 and pre-release alpha and beta versions before 5.0.0-beta.3 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs.\n\nWhen a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n\nAn initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.\n\n###

validation","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"## Description: \nDuring some analysis today on npm's `node-tar` package I came across the folder creation process, Basicly if you provide node-tar with a path like this `./a/b/c/foo.txt` it would create every folder and sub-folder here a, b and c until it reaches the last folder to create `foo.txt`, In-this case I noticed that there's no validation at all on the amount of folders being created, that said we're actually able to CPU and memory consume the system running node-tar and even crash the nodejs client within few seconds of running it using a path with too many sub-folders inside\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\nYou can reproduce this issue by downloading the tar file I provided in the resources and using node-tar to extract it, you should get the same behavior as the video\n\n## Proof Of Concept:\nHere's a
