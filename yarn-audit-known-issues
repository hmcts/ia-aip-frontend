[31m[1mUsage Error[22m[39m: The nearest package directory (/Users/tiagreaney/Downloads/iac/ia-aip-frontend) doesn't seem to be part of the project declared in /Users/tiagreaney.

- If /Users/tiagreaney isn't intended to be a project, remove any yarn.lock and/or package.json file there.
- If /Users/tiagreaney is intended to be a project, it might be that you forgot to list Downloads/iac/ia-aip-frontend in its workspace configuration.
- Finally, if /Users/tiagreaney is fine and you intend Downloads/iac/ia-aip-frontend to be treated as a completely separate project (not even a workspace), create an empty yarn.lock file in it.
