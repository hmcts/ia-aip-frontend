Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.\n2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](https://github.com/rrlapointe) in https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231\n\n[`--max-http-header-size=size`]: https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize\n[`maxHeaderSize`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener\n[`server.maxHeadersCount`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q"},"1097682":{"findings":[{"version":"4.0.0","paths":["jsdom>tough-cookie","@hmcts/ia-idam-express-middleware>request>tough-cookie","@hmcts/ia-idam-express-middleware>request-promise-native>request>tough-cookie"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<4.1.3","module_name":"tough-cookie","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-72xf-g2v4-qvf3","cves":["CVE-2023-26136"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=4.1.3","cvss":{"score":6.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"},"updated":"2024-06-21T21:33:53.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 4.1.3 or later","cwe":["CWE-1321"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1097682,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26136\n- https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/issues/282\n- https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/commit/12d474791bb856004e858fdb1c47b7608d09cf6e\n- https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/releases/tag/v4.1.3\n- https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-TOUGHCOOKIE-5672873\n- https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/07/msg00010.html\n- https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3HUE6ZR5SL73KHL7XUPAOEL6SB7HUDT2\n- https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6PVVPNSAGSDS63HQ74PJ7MZ3MU5IYNVZ\n- https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-72xf-g2v4-qvf3","created":"2023-07-01T06:30:16.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"tough-cookie Prototype Pollution vulnerability","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"Versions of the package tough-cookie before 4.1.3 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution due to improper handling of Cookies when using CookieJar in `rejectPublicSuffixes=false` mode.
